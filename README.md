Small microcontroller to automatically press all the annoying buttons in a GR Yaris (Gen 1 UK Circuit Pack).
This design uses a Digispark ATtiny85 dev board, attached to a custom daughter board.

In this repository you will find:
* Installation Guide <- probably a good place to start
* Car wiring information
* PCB schematic
* Code that is running on the MCU
* 3D files for the case
