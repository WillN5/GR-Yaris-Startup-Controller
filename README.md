# GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller
This device will automatically press all the annoying buttons in a GR Yaris when you first start your car:
* Lane Departure Alert (turn off)
* iMT (turn on)
* Auto Stop/Start (turn off)
* Select Sport/Track mode

In this repository you will find:
* Installation Guide <- probably a good place to start
* Car wiring information
* PCB schematic
* Code that is running on the Digispark ATtiny85 dev board
* 3D files for the case
* Pictures

This project is a development of that idea to include the additional button presses, wrapped up in a neat package.
