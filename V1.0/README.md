This device will automatically press any (or all) of the annoying buttons in a GR Yaris when you first start your car:
* Lane Departure Alert (turn off)
* iMT (turn on)
* Auto Stop/Start (turn off)
* Select Sport/Track mode

In this repository you will find:
* [Overview & Installation Guide]([url](https://github.com/WillN5/GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller/tree/main/V1.0/Docs)) <- probably a good place to start
* [Car wiring information]([url](https://github.com/WillN5/GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller/tree/main/V1.0/Docs))
* [PCB schematic]([url](https://github.com/WillN5/GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller/tree/main/V1.0/PCB))
* [Code]([url](https://github.com/WillN5/GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller/tree/main/V1.0/Code/Startup_Controller_Code_V1))
* [3D files for the case]([url](https://github.com/WillN5/GR-Yaris-Startup-Controller/tree/main/V1.0/Housing))
* Pictures (/Docs) *NOT YET COMPLETED*

Credit for idea goes to MagnusT and his original post here:<br/>

This project is a development of that idea to include the additional button presses, wrapped up in a (hopefully) neat package.
